## ![](/icons/icon_conceito.png) About the Project

Coming to another stage of our course, I was asked to deliver a simple project made in HTML, using knowledge such as JavaScript, JQuery and API. I created a mini site where you can browse through these three subjects and learn more about them. Exercises proposed in the classroom were also carried out within the topics. Thus structuring a complete site with informative content and exercises for practice.
